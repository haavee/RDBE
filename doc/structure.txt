Hi Harro,

the typical folder structure is all in /usr2 and contains

/usr2/fs    # usually a link to the /usr2/fs-9.XXX folder, which contains
the FS
/usr2/sched   # vex-files, snap-files ect.
/usr2/proc     # prc-files
/usr2/control   # mostly ctl-files, in my case a link to control_rdbe
/usr2/st          # station code, link to /usr2/st-0.0.0_rdbe

Cheers,
Uwe
