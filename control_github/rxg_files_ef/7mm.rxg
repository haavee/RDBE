* if type is range, the two values: lower and upper frequencies
* if type is fixed, then one or two fixed value
* frequencies in MHz

* 3rd line: FWHM beamwidthm format:
*   model value

* if type is frequncy, then fwhm=value*1.22*c/(freq*diameter)
*                      value is 1.0 if omitted
* if type is constant, then fwhm=value (degrees)
